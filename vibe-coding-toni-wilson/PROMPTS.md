My Vibe Coding Prompts

Prompt 1: Initial Build
-	What I asked: 
I asked the AI to help me build a simple calculator in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

-	What the AI did:
It provided a complete code file with styled buttons and interactive logic.

-	What worked:
The design looked good, and the buttons lit up when clicked.

-	What didn’t work:
The calculator didn’t fully respond — some buttons were missing or the logic was incomplete.

-	What I learned:
I realized that AI can give me a strong starting point, but I need to test and debug carefully.

Prompt 2: Fixing Functionality
-	What I asked:
I asked the AI to fix the calculator so that pressing buttons would actually show numbers and results.

-	What the AI did:
It rebuilt the calculator with simpler JavaScript logic using eval() to handle expressions.

-	What worked:
The calculator finally responded correctly and displayed results.

-	What didn’t work:
Earlier drafts were cut off or incomplete, which slowed progress.

-	What I learned:
Sometimes simpler code is better, and I need to understand the logic myself to troubleshoot.

Prompt 3: Adding Features
-	What I asked:
I asked for extra features like score tracking and later a memory bank.

-	What the AI did:
It added a score counter first, then replaced it with a memory bank that stored past equations.

-	What worked:
The memory bank displayed previous calculations and made the calculator more useful.

-	What didn’t work:
The score feature didn’t feel meaningful for a calculator, so I switched to memory storage.

-	What I learned:
Features should match the purpose of the app — memory tracking made more sense than scoring.

Prompt 4: Layout Change
-	What I asked:
I asked to make the calculator landscape, with the memory bank beside it instead of underneath.

-	What the AI did:
It restructured the layout using CSS flexbox so the calculator and memory bank sat side by side.

-	What worked:
The new layout looked cleaner and more professional.

-	What didn’t work:
Nothing major, but I had to adjust widths to make it fit well.

-	What I learned:
Layout changes are easier when you understand CSS flexbox and responsive design.

Prompt 5: Framework Experiment
-	What I asked:
I asked about Single Page Applications (SPAs) and which framework would be best for rebuilding the calculator.

-	What the AI did:
It explained SPAs, compared frameworks, and recommended React for my project.

-	What worked:
I understood why React is good for small interactive apps and how it manages state.

-	What didn’t work:
Setting up React required extra downloads and setup, which felt heavier for a small calculator.

-	What I learned:
Frameworks like React are powerful for bigger projects, but plain HTML/JS can be simpler for small ones.
